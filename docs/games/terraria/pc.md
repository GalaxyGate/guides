# Hosting a terraria server for PC
## Introduction
In this guide, you will be able to host a PC terraria server as well as keeping it alive without having to be logged in all the time. Before you start, make sure you meet the requirements and have a basic understanding of Linux, if you have issues or are stuck on a step you can ask for help in our [support server.](https://discord.gg/jcKEyxn)


## Requirements 
* You have a Linux VPS (Debian/Ubuntu).
* You are logged in as root or have a user that can use sudo.
* You know how to establish an SSH connection or use an SSH client.
<br/>

*Don't know how to connect to your server? Check out this [guide](../../basics/first_login.md)*

## Installing required packages
I recommend that you should be logged in as root before executing these commands to ensure everything goes smoothly.

```
apt update && apt upgrade -y 
apt install sudo curl wget file unzip zip -y
```
!!! warning 
    You may get a popup like the one below, use the arrow key to click yes to proceed.

## Creating a user for terraria
For security purposes, terraria should not be running under the root user. We will create a new system user and group with home directory /opt/terraria that will run the terraria server:

```
useradd -r -m -U -d /opt/terraria -s /bin/bash terraria
```
We are not going to set a password for this user. This is a good security practice because this user will not be able to log in via SSH. To login to the terraria user, youâ€™ll need to be logged in to the server as root or user with sudo privileges.

Before starting with the installation process, make sure you switch to the terraria user.

```
sudo su - terraria
```

## Creating the Directory 
If you plan to both versions of the server running I would recommend creating a folder for them to make sure the files do not conflict.
```
mkdir PC
cd PC
```


## Getting the server files
Please download one of the server files from below.

Latest
```
wget https://terraria.org/api/download/pc-dedicated-server/terraria-server-1449.zip -O server.zip
```

!!! information
    Don't see the version you are looking for? you can grab the server files from this [website](https://terraria.gamepedia.com/Server#Downloads)

## Using the files
Please run the commands below:
```
unzip -q server.zip
cp -R 1*/Linux/* ./ 
chmod +x TerrariaServer.bin.x86_64 
rm -rf server.zip 
rm -rf version_number_downloaded_goes_here
chown -R terraria:terraria /opt/terraria

```

## Running the server
Run the command below to get started.
```
./TerrariaServer.bin.x86_64 
```
## Connecting to the server
You should grab the IP of your server which can be found using the command below if you do not know it.

```
dig +short myip.opendns.com @resolver1.opendns.com
```
!!! Note
    If the command above fails, try this command and copy the output as that is the IP of your server.

    ```curl icanhazip.com```
 Copy the IP and open terraria up, go to servers and click add a server and under `Server Address` put the server's IP in and click Done.

## Keeping your server alive
### Screen

Screen is one way of keeping your server running in the background without having to keep your SSH session open.

!!! warning
    `screen` does not boot on load or write logs to the disk automatically, reboots would kill the screen due to only being a virtual session.

To start your server with screen, first, make sure you have `screen` package installed.

#### Installation
You should've installed screen from the start of the guide. In the eventuality that you do not have `screen package` installed, please use the command below and make sure you're using root or sudo. You can install screen using the one-liner below:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install screen -y
```
!!! warning
    Make sure you are using root if you are still on the terraria account use `exit`, then execute the commands after you are done you should use the command listed to switch back to the terraria account `sudo su - terraria`.
#### Usage
You can then start your server by using the command below:
```bash
screen -S terraria -L 
./TerrariaServer.bin.x86_64 
```
This should create a session you can safely leave without fear of it shutting down when you leave, 
You can leave the screen via `CTRL+AD` from this session so your Server is still online when you leave.

You can re-attach to the running screen by running `screen -r terraria` and either issue commands or shutdown the server via `CTRL+C`.
