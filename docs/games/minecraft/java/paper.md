# Hosting a Paper Minecraft server

## Introduction
In this guide, you will be able to host a Paper Minecraft server as well as keeping it alive without having to be logged in all the time. Before you start, make sure you meet the requirements and have a basic understanding of Linux, if you have issues or are stuck on a step you can ask for help in our [support server.](https://discord.gg/jcKEyxn)

## Requirements 
* You have a Linux VPS (Debian/Ubuntu).
* You are logged in as root or have a user that can use sudo.
* You know how to establish an SSH connection or use an SSH client.
<br/>

*Don't know how to connect to your server? Check out this [guide.](../../../basics/first_login.md)*

## Installing required packages
I recommend that you should be logged in as root before executing these commands to ensure everything goes smoothly.

```
apt update && apt upgrade -y 
apt install sudo screen unzip curl wget -y 
```
!!! warning 
    You may get a popup like the one below, use the arrow key to click yes to proceed.

## Creating a user for Minecraft
For security purposes, minecraft should not be running under the root user. We will create a new system user and group with home directory /opt/minecraft that will run the minecraft server:

```
sudo useradd -r -m -U -d /opt/minecraft -s /bin/bash minecraft
```
We are not going to set a password for this user. This is a good security practice because this user will not be able to log in via SSH. To login to the Minecraft user, youâ€™ll need to be logged in to the server as root or user with sudo privileges.

Before starting with the installation process, make sure you switch to the Minecraft user.

```
sudo su - minecraft
```

## Creating the Directory 
If you plan to have multiple versions of Minecraft running I would recommend creating a folder for them to make sure the files do not conflict.
```
mkdir paper
cd paper
```

## Installing Java
Run the commands below on the Minecraft user we created above.
```
curl -sL https://github.com/shyiko/jabba/raw/master/install.sh | bash && . ~/.jabba/jabba.sh
jabba install openjdk@1.14.0
jabba alias default openjdk@1.14.0
```
!!! Information 
    Run `java` to see if was installed correctly. 
!!! Note
    1.17+ should run this instead!
```
jabba install openjdk@1.17.0
jabba alias default openjdk@1.17.0
```
## Getting the server jar
Please download one of the server Jars from below. Currently, 1.20.1 is the latest server jar.
1.20.1
```
wget https://api.papermc.io/v2/projects/paper/versions/1.20.1/builds/145/downloads/paper-1.20.1-145.jar -O server.jar
```
1.20
```
wget https://api.papermc.io/v2/projects/paper/versions/1.20/builds/17/downloads/paper-1.20-17.jar -O server.jar
```
1.19.4
```
wget https://api.papermc.io/v2/projects/paper/versions/1.19.4/builds/550/downloads/paper-1.19.4-550.jar -O server.jar
```
!!! information
    Don't see the version you are looking for? you can grab the server jar from this [website](https://papermc.io/legacy) or [here](https://papermc.io/downloads/all)

## Running the server
First, make sure you do have java installed by running `java` and make sure you have the server jar file by running `ls` and you should see `server.jar` or the file you downloaded, to run the server run the command below once.
```
java -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar server.jar nogui
```
You will get a message asking you to accept the EULA.
![EULA](./assets/paper/eula.png)

To accept the EULA just edit eula.txt and change false to true.
```
nano eula.txt
```
Before:
![EULA_file](./assets/paper/eula_file.png)
After:
![EULA_TRUE](./assets/paper/eula_accept.png)

!!! note
    To exit from nano use Ctrl + X and Y to save the edited text.
Next, you can run the same command again to start the server.
```
java -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar server.jar nogui
```
!!! Hint
    server.jar might include numbering depending where you have downloaded your jar from, you can also increase the ram used by upping the Xmx and Xms flags.

## Connecting to the server
You should grab the IP of your server which can be found using the command below if you do not know it.

```
dig +short myip.opendns.com @resolver1.opendns.com
```
!!! Note
    If the command above fails, try this command and copy the output as that is the IP of your server.

    ```curl icanhazip.com```
 Copy the IP and open Minecraft up, go to servers and click add a server and under `Server Address` put the server's IP in and click Done.

## Keeping your server alive
### Screen

Screen is one way of keeping your server running in the background without having to keep your SSH session open.

!!! warning
    `screen` does not boot on load or write logs to the disk automatically, reboots would kill the screen due to only being a virtual session.

To start your server with screen, first, make sure you have `screen` package installed.

#### Installation
You should've installed screen from the start of the guide. In the eventuality that you do not have `screen package` installed, please use the command below and make sure you're using root or sudo. You can install screen using the one-liner below:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install screen -y
```
!!! warning
    Make sure you are using root if you are still on the Minecraft account use `exit`, then execute the commands after you are done you should use the command listed to switch back to the Minecraft account `sudo su - minecraft`.
#### Usage
You can then start your server by using the command below:
```bash
screen -S Paper -L java -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar server.jar nogui
```
This should create a session you can safely leave without fear of it shutting down when you leave, 
You can leave the screen via `CTRL+AD` from this session so your Server is still online when you leave.

You can re-attach to the running screen by running `screen -r Paper` and either issue commands or shutdown the server via `CTRL+C`.
### Systemd
Systemd can be an easy way of keeping your Minecraft server up, setting a service file for Minecraft should be easy and quick if you follow closely, first you should switch to root for this by running the command below.
#### Installation
```
exit
```
Once you are root we will start by creating a service file called `minecraft@paper.service` in `/etc/systemd/system/`.
```
nano /etc/systemd/system/minecraft@paper.service
```
Next, a screen like this will show up, you will fill it up with the config provided below.
![systemd_blank](./assets/paper/systemd_blank.png)
Use this config.
```ini
[Unit]
Description=Paper Minecraft server
After=network.target
Wants=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=minecraft
WorkingDirectory=/opt/minecraft/paper/
ExecStart=/opt/minecraft/.jabba/jdk/openjdk@1.14.0/bin/java -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar server.jar nogui
Restart=always
RestartSec=10

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
![completed_systemd](./assets/paper/systemd_completed.png)

!!! Hint
    To exit out of nano, use Ctrl + X and hit Y

Run the commands below to test and start the server
```
systemctl daemon-reload 
systemctl start minecraft@paper.service 
systemctl status minecraft@paper.service
systemctl enable minecraft@paper.service

```
#### Usage
Here are some commands that will help you effectively manage the service.

```
systemctl start minecraft@paper.service 
```
Restart service:
```
systemctl restart minecraft@paper.service 
```
Status of service:
```
systemctl status minecraft@paper.service 
```
Stop service:
```
systemctl stop minecraft@paper.service 
```
View logs:
```
journalctl -n 50 -f -u minecraft@paper.service
```
