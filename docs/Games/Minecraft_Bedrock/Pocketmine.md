# Hosting a PocketMine-MP Server

## Introduction
In this guide, you will be able to host a PocketMine-MP Minecraft server as well as keeping it alive without having to be logged in all the time. Before you start, make sure you meet the requirements and have a basic understanding of Linux, if you have issues or are stuck on a step you can ask for help in our [support server.](https://discord.gg/jcKEyxn)

## Requirements 
* You have a Linux VPS (Debian/Ubuntu).
* You are logged in as root or have a user that can use sudo.
* You know how to establish an SSH connection or use an SSH client.
<br/>

*If you do not know how to connect to your server I would recommend using an SSH client like [bitvise](https://www.bitvise.com/ssh-client-download) or [Putty](https://www.putty.org/) and ask for help in our [support server.](https://discord.gg/jcKEyxn)*

## Creating a user for Minecraft
For security purposes, Minecraft should not be running under the root user. We will create a new system user and group with home directory /opt/Minecraft that will run the Minecraft server:

```
sudo useradd -r -m -U -d /opt/Minecraft -s /bin/bash Minecraft
```
We are not going to set a password for this user. This is a good security practice because this user will not be able to log in via SSH. To login to the Minecraft user, youâ€™ll need to be logged in to the server as root or user with sudo privileges.

Before starting with the installation process, make sure you switch to the Minecraft user.

```
sudo su - Minecraft
```
